 Let you use State and other React features without writing class.(Hooks are  a new addition in React16.8)
Hook is a special function.
Example: useState is a Hook that lets you add React  state to function components.
Rules to follow while writing Hooks
.Always write it inside the component or function
.Component must be PascalCase(First letter should be uppercase)
.we can directly import or we can directly write it using React.hookName
Dont call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
Ternary opertors are use instead of if - else for react toggle
spread opertors({...myObject, (the object we want to change that we want to change)})const [myObject,setmyObject] = useState({})
